WEAPON DETECTION using YOLOv3

Description :

This project demonstrates the use of the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time weapon detection.There are two versions of the code:
Webcam-based weapon detection: Uses the webcam to detect weapons in real-time.
Video file-based weapon detection: Uses a pre-recorded video file to detect weapons.

Features :

Real-time detection of weapons using a webcam or a video file.
Bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.
Customizable detection thresholds.
Technologies and Libraries Used
Python (version 3.x)
OpenCV: Library for computer vision tasks.
NumPy: Library for numerical computations.
YOLOv3: Pre-trained deep learning model for object detection.


   
TO RUN :

 my repository and download the file in my description and run it using python
 
    weapon_detection1.py
          
   To run yolo you should  use command python
   
    weapon_detection.py
