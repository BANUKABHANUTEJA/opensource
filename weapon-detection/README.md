Weapon Detection using YOLOv3
Description
This project demonstrates the use of the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time weapon detection. There are two versions of the code:

Webcam-based weapon detection: Uses the webcam to detect weapons in real-time.
Video file-based weapon detection: Uses a pre-recorded video file to detect weapons.
Features
Real-time detection of weapons using a webcam or a video file.
Bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.
Customizable detection thresholds.
Technologies and Libraries Used
Python (version 3.x)
OpenCV: Library for computer vision tasks.
NumPy: Library for numerical computations.
YOLOv3: Pre-trained deep learning model for object detection.

NOTE:-
    To run this code u need to clone  my repository and download the file in my description and run it using python weapon_detection.py
